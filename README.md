# Project Analysis
## Introduction
Mental health is an increasingly important aspect of overall well-being, yet many individuals struggle to maintain a healthy balance between work, sleep, and physical activity. With this project, I aimed to analyze key factors affecting mental health by leveraging data from a diverse population. By exploring various lifestyle attributes such as sleep hours, work hours, and physical activity, I sought to uncover patterns and insights that can help individuals make informed decisions to improve their mental health and well-being.

2. **Is there a relationship between stress levels and sleep duration across different occupations.**
3. **How does the balance between work hours and physical activity impact stress levels?**
4. **How does sleep quality correlate with reported stress levels?**
